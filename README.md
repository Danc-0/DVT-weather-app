* Technologies/Libraries Used
  * [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)ðŸš€ - Libraries that help follow best practices, reduce boilerplate code, and write code that works consistently across Android versions and devices so that developers can focus on the code they care about.
  * [Dagger-Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - For dependency injection
  * [Compose Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation)
  * [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines?gclid=CjwKCAjwk_WVBhBZEiwAUHQCmdx8rjojm7dxpQ2EGOYQydzDN3DbqnzZBC0nq-GGzvdmCvnnFYvgFRoCyPEQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) - Is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously
  * [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) - Is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value.
  * [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - Provide an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite
  * [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - Class through which API Interfaces turn callable objects
  * [Material UI]()
  * [Google Location API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/overview)
  * [Lottie](https://lottiefiles.com/featured) - For Animations
  * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel?gclid=CjwKCAjwjJmIBhA4EiwAQdCbxrvUiq3wgakPX8sop8Kp8irusL4bi_9xCnaiZkUJqBzTbOTB2FB4XRoCujoQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) - Manage UI related data in a lifecycle conscious way and act as a channel between use cases and ui
 
## CI/CD
  * [Fastlane](https://docs.fastlane.tools/) -  is the easiest way to automate beta deployments and releases for your Android apps
